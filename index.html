      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>Detroit: Become Human is an interactive drama and action-adventure game developed by Quantic Dream. 
        The game is set in a futuristic Detroit in the year 2038, where advanced androids are integrated into society,
        performing tasks like household chores, factory labor, and assisting the elderly. The story revolves around three main android protagonists Kara, Connor,
        and Markus who each experience a different path toward self-awareness and autonomy.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay and Stakes</h2>
      <p>Gameplay in Detroit: Become Human centers on decision-making and exploration. Players control the three protagonists,
        switching between their perspectives throughout the story. The game is heavily driven by choices, with each decision impacting 
        the narrative and leading to various outcomes. Stakes are high as every choice can result in life or death for the characters and 
        others around them. The game emphasizes moral dilemmas, forcing players to weigh loyalty, survival, and ethics in their decisions.</p>

      <h2>The Narrative Arc</h2>
      <p>The story begins with androids firmly under human control. Kara escapes an abusive owner to protect a young girl, Connor is an advanced detective android hunting deviant androids, and Markus becomes a revolutionary leader fighting for android rights. 
      Over time, these characters grapple with themes of freedom, identity, and morality. The narrative builds to a climax as Markus’ revolution, Connor’s investigation, and Kara’s journey for safety converge, creating an emotionally charged tapestry of interconnected stories.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Detroit: Become Human is a compelling exploration of humanity, morality, and free will. Its narrative-driven gameplay and 
        emotional depth make it both entertaining and thought-provoking. The game's resonance with Brian Massumi’s concept of affect—as described in 
        "The Autonomy of Affect"—adds an intellectual dimension, showcasing how emotions and instinctual responses shape the characters’ 
        paths to self-awareness. For me, the game is not just entertaining but also a powerful reflection on societal issues like 
        discrimination and the fight for equality.</p>
