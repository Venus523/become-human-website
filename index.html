      <h2>About the Game!</h2>
      <p>Detroit: Become Human is an interactive drama and action-adventure game developed by Quantic Dream. 
        The game is set in a futuristic Detroit in the year 2038, where advanced androids are integrated into society,
        performing tasks like household chores, factory labor, and assisting the elderly. The story revolves around three main android protagonists—Kara, Connor,
        and Markus—who each experience a different path toward self-awareness and autonomy.</p>
      <p>In Detroit: Become Human, I see a clear connection to Massumi's, The Autonomy of Affect both explore how emotions and instinctual responses shape behavior before cognitive reasoning. Just like Massumi’s concept of affect being an intense, pre-cognitive force, the androids in the game start to experience visceral, emotional responses that drive them to make choices outside of their programming. This emotional intensity, unfiltered by logic, becomes a transformative force, pushing the androids toward autonomy and self-awareness, much like how affect can lead to new forms of subjectivity and resistance.</p>
